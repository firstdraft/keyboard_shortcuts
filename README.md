Here are some of my favorite keyboard shortcuts:

## OS X

 - CMD-Space: Spotlight

 - CMD-R: Refresh page in Chrome
 - CMD-A: Select all
 - CMD-C: Copy
 - CMD-X: Cut
 - CMD-P: Paste
 - CMD-W: Close tab
 - CMD-Q: Quit app
 - CMD-F: Find in file
 - CTRL-E: Move cursor to end of line
 - CTRL-A: Move cursor to beginning of line
 - CTRL-K: Delete text from cursor to end of line
 
 
 - Shift-CMD-F: Find in project
 - CMD-D: Find next match of highlighted text; keep tapping `D` to find more. Tap `U` to undo if you over shoot. Puts a cursor at each match so you can make bulk changes.
 - Shift-CMD-D: Duplicates the line your cursor is currently on.
 
 
 - CMD-CTRL-W: Closes all tabs.
 - Option-clicking on a folder in the tree view collapses all subfolders.
